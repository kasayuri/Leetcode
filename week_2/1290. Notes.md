## Bitwise operations 
- https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/bitwise-operations-in-C-Sharp/


There are two kinds of Shift operations on Right Shift and Left Shift.

- Right Shift operation is used for shifting the bits positions towards right side.

- Left Shift operation is used for shifting the bits positions towards left side.

When Right Shift operations are done on a binary value the bits are shifted to one position towards right side.

Let's take an example:

> The binary equivalent for the decimal value 10 is 1010. So when Right Shift operation is done this value. All the bits will move one position towards right so the right most bits will be truncated and left most bits is filled with zero.

1010 when shifted to right one position its value will be 0101

So the decimal equivalent for 0101 is 5. This means when decimal value 10 shifted to right one position its value is reduced to 5.

In C# to implement the Right shift operation using '>>' Operator.
